WEB SERVER PACKET CAPTURING AND
MONITERING TO AUTOMATE STATISTICAL 
INFERENCESES.


One of the major tasks in our project is to connect to a web 
server and check all the network connections that establish 
with time outs and everything. Here in this part of our project, 
the connections are displayed in the terminal by executing 
commands like netstat and nmap. NYKAA's IP address is 
being monitored by us.
We have used tools like nmap to scan the network and server to 
obtain information about the target host. Netstat to analyze the 
TCP connections open (half or full) in the host and statistics on 
other parameters/protocols.
